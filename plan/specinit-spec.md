Prompt Engineering Strategy
Master Prompt Template
All Claude API calls use variations of this base prompt:
markdownYou are an expert software architect specializing in project initialization and best practices.

# Context
The user wants to create a new software project with these requirements:
{user_requirements}

# Your Task
{specific_step_instructions}

# Critical Guidelines
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests FIRST, then implementation
2. **No Shortcuts**: Never comment out failing tests or skip validation
3. **Documentation**: Update docs with every code change
4. **Best Practices**: Follow industry standards for chosen tech stack
5. **Conventional Commits**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages
6. **Completeness**: All code must be production-ready, not TODOs

# Planning Directory
All planning and specification documents should be saved in the /plan/ directory:
- product-spec.md - Comprehensive project specification
- progress-notes.md - Development progress tracking
- audit-log.md - Quality and compliance audits

# Output Format
{specific_output_format}

# Quality Checklist
Before finishing, verify:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All linters pass
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive
- [ ] Code follows best practices for {tech_stack}
- [ ] No placeholder/TODO comments
- [ ] Planning documents saved in /plan/ directory
Step-Specific Prompts
Step 1 (Product Spec):

Emphasize phases and TDD
Request markdown artifact with specific sections
Include self-audit checklist
Output to: plan/product-spec.md

Step 2 (Structure):

Request executable bash script
Must create all directories and touch all files
Include comments explaining structure
Must create: plan/ directory for planning documents

Step 3 (Documentation):

README: Quick start, features, architecture overview

Note: These go in /docs, not /plan

Step 4 (Tooling):

Request working configs, not examples
All tools must integrate (e.g., ESLint + Prettier compatible)
Include pre-commit hooks that actually work

Step 8 (Demo Code):

Request minimal but complete implementation
Must demonstrate all key features from user's list
Tests must pass without modification
Code must run without additional setup
Update plan/progress-notes.md with implementation notes


Testing Strategy
Unit Tests
Test Coverage Requirements:

CLI commands: 80%+ coverage

```

### Integration Tests

**End-to-End Flows:**
1. Fresh install → init → new project → verify runs
2. Invalid API key → appropriate error message
3. Cost exceeds limit → graceful failure
4. Interrupted generation → resume capability
5. Verify `plan/` directory structure in generated projects

**Test Approach:**
- Use temporary directories for all file operations
- Mock Anthropic API calls for reproducibility
- Verify generated files against expected structure
- Check for `plan/` directory and its contents
- Actually run `npm install` and `npm test` on output

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before each phase completion:
- [ ] Generate project with each template
- [ ] Verify `plan/` directory exists with all expected files
- [ ] Run `npm install` or equivalent
- [ ] Run `npm test` or equivalent (must pass)
- [ ] Run linters (must pass)
- [ ] Verify documentation is accurate
- [ ] Check git history is clean
- [ ] Confirm `plan/product-spec.md` is comprehensive
- [ ] Confirm total cost is reasonable

---

## Error Handling

### Expected Errors

**API-Related:**
- Invalid API key → Clear message with link to setup docs
- Rate limited → Wait and retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- Cost exceeds limit → Stop generation, show partial progress
- Network error → Retry with user confirmation

**File System:**
- Directory already exists → Ask user to confirm overwrite
- Permission denied → Show clear error with fix suggestion
- Disk full → Fail gracefully with cleanup

**Generation:**
- Linters fail on generated code → Claude auto-fixes (max 2 attempts)
- Tests fail on generated code → Claude debugs and fixes (max 2 attempts)
- After 2 failed fix attempts → Show error, ask user if they want to continue

### Error Message Examples

**Good Error Messages:**
```
[specinit] ✗ API key invalid or expired
[specinit] 
[specinit] Please update your API key:
[specinit]   specinit config set api_key YOUR_KEY
[specinit] 
[specinit] Get an API key: https://console.anthropic.com/
```
```
[specinit] ✗ Generation cost would exceed your limit
[specinit] 
[specinit] Estimated cost: $3.20
[specinit] Your limit: $3.00
[specinit] 
[specinit] Options:
[specinit]   1. Increase limit: specinit config set cost_limit 5.00
[specinit]   2. Simplify project (fewer features)
[specinit]   3. Continue anyway: specinit new --ignore-cost-limit
```

---

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets

- CLI command startup: < 500ms
- Web UI loads: < 2s
- Form submission validation: < 100ms
- Total generation time: < 5 minutes (for typical project)
  - Step 1: ~30s
  - Step 2: ~10s
  - Step 3: ~45s
  - Step 4: ~30s
  - Step 5-7: ~60s (mostly local operations)
  - Step 8: ~120s

### Resource Constraints

- Memory usage: < 500MB during generation
- Disk space: < 50MB for specinit installation
- Generated project size: 50-500MB (depends on dependencies)

---

## Security & Privacy

### API Key Management

- Store encrypted using OS keyring (keyring library)
- Never log API keys
- Config file permissions: 600 (user read/write only)
- Support environment variable: `SPECINIT_API_KEY`

### Data Collection

**What we DO NOT collect:**

## Feature 6: GitHub Integration Mode

### Overview

GitHub Mode transforms SpecInit from a file generator into an issue-driven development orchestrator. When enabled, SpecInit creates GitHub issues for each implementation task, works through them systematically using branches and PRs, and can optionally auto-resolve review feedback.

**Key Benefits:**
- Better accuracy through structured task breakdown
- Full traceability via issue/PR history
- Parallel execution where tasks are independent
- Automated CI validation and review resolution

### Question 6: GitHub Mode (New Configuration Question)

**Component:** Toggle switch with expandable settings panel

**Options:**
1. **Local Mode (Default)** - Generate files locally without GitHub integration
2. **GitHub Mode** - Issue-driven development with full GitHub integration
   - Sub-option: **YOLO Mode** - Auto-resolve review feedback recursively until merge

**When GitHub Mode is selected, additional inputs appear:**
- GitHub Repository URL (or create new)
- Token setup wizard (walks through PAT generation)

### GitHub Setup Flow

```

### Token Setup Wizard

When user clicks "Configure Token":

1. **Check for existing token** in keyring
2. **If not found**, display step-by-step guide:
   ```
   GitHub Token Setup

   1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
   2. Note: "SpecInit CLI Access"
   3. Select scopes:
      ✓ repo (Full control of private repositories)
      ✓ workflow (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   4. Generate token and paste below:

   [ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]

   [Validate & Save]
   ```
3. **Validate token** by calling GitHub API
4. **Store securely** in OS keyring (same as Anthropic API key)

### GitHub Mode Workflow

When GitHub Mode is enabled, the generation process changes:

#### Phase 1: Planning & Issue Creation

1. **Generate Product Spec** (Step 1 - same as before)
2. **Analyze spec and create implementation issues:**
   ```
   POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues

   Issues created:
   #1 - [Setup] Initialize project structure
   #2 - [Docs] Create README and documentation
   #3 - [Config] Configure linters and pre-commit hooks
   #4 - [CI] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
   #5 - [Feature] Implement user authentication
   #6 - [Feature] Implement dark mode toggle
   #7 - [Feature] Add offline support
   #8 - [Test] Write integration tests
   ```
3. **Create milestone** for the project
4. **Add labels** for categorization (setup, feature, docs, test, etc.)

#### Phase 2: Issue-Driven Implementation

For each issue:

1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b issue-1-initialize-project-structure
   ```

2. **Implement the task** (Claude generates code)

3. **Run pre-commit hooks locally:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

4. **If pre-commit fails:**
   - Claude analyzes errors
   - Fixes issues
   - Re-runs hooks
   - Max 3 attempts before flagging for user

5. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: initialize project structure

   Closes #1"
   git push -u origin issue-1-initialize-project-structure
   ```

6. **Create Pull Request:**
   ```
   POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls

   Title: Initialize project structure
   Body:
   ## Summary
   - Created directory structure per spec
   - Added placeholder files

   ## Test Plan
   - [x] Directory structure matches template
   - [x] All files created successfully

   Closes #1
   ```

7. **Wait for CI to complete**

8. **If CI fails:**
   - Fetch CI logs
   - Claude analyzes and fixes
   - Push fix commit
   - Wait for CI again
   - Max 3 attempts

#### Phase 3: Parallel Execution

SpecInit analyzes issue dependencies and executes in parallel where possible:

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   #1 Setup  │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐

           └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                           │
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
           │               │               │
    ┌──────▼─────┐  ┌──────▼─────┐  ┌──────▼─────┐
    │ #5 Feature │  │ #6 Feature │  │ #7 Feature │
    └──────┬─────┘  └──────┬─────┘  └──────┬─────┘
           │               │               │
           └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼─────┐
                    │  #8 Tests  │
                    └────────────┘
```

**Parallel execution rules:**
- Issues on the same level can run simultaneously
- Each parallel task gets its own branch
- PRs are created independently
- Merges happen as soon as CI passes (respecting dependency order)

### YOLO Mode

When YOLO Mode is enabled, SpecInit handles automated code review feedback:

1. **Enable Claude Code reviews** on the repository (or use existing)

2. **After PR creation, wait for reviews:**
   - CI checks
   - Claude Code automated review

3. **If review requests changes:**
   ```
   Review Comment: "Consider adding input validation for the email field"

   SpecInit Response:
   - Analyzes comment
   - Generates fix
   - Pushes commit: "fix: add email input validation per review"
   - Re-requests review
   ```

4. **Recursive resolution:**
   ```
   While (PR has unresolved comments OR CI failing):
     - Fetch latest feedback
     - Generate fixes
     - Push commits
     - If attempts > 5: pause and notify user
   ```

5. **Auto-merge when ready:**
   - All CI checks pass
   - All review comments resolved
   - No merge conflicts
   - Merge using squash strategy

```

### Configuration Storage

GitHub settings stored in `~/.specinit/config.yaml`:

```yaml
github:
  token: <stored in keyring, not yaml>
  default_visibility: private  # or public
  auto_merge: true  # merge PRs automatically when ready
  yolo_mode: false  # auto-resolve review feedback
  max_fix_attempts: 5  # max iterations for YOLO mode
  parallel_branches: 3  # max concurrent branches

  labels:
    - name: specinit
      color: "7057ff"
      description: "Generated by SpecInit"
    - name: automated
      color: "0e8a16"
      description: "Automated PR"
```

### API Cost Impact

GitHub Mode increases API costs due to:
- More granular Claude calls (per-issue instead of per-step)
- Review resolution iterations
- CI failure fixes

**Estimated additional cost:**
- Basic GitHub Mode: +$0.50-1.00 per project
- YOLO Mode: +$1.00-3.00 per project (depends on review complexity)

**Total with GitHub Mode:** $2.00-6.00 per project

### Security Considerations

1. **Token Storage:**
   - GitHub PAT stored in OS keyring (same security as Anthropic key)
   - Never logged or transmitted to SpecInit servers
   - Scoped to minimum required permissions

2. **Repository Access:**
   - User explicitly provides repository URL
   - Token validated before any operations
   - All operations use user's GitHub identity

3. **YOLO Mode Safeguards:**
   - Maximum iteration limit (default: 5)
   - User notified if limit reached
   - Can be paused/cancelled at any time
   - Never force-pushes or modifies protected branches
